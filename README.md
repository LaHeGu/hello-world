# hello-world
my first trials here

Hello titans!

Henning here, I started to become more and more interested in Data Science, AI, Machine Learning and all these things via searching for people who have these kind of positions or who want to have them with a focus on Germany. 
Talking about what people are doing and what tools and languages are being used I started to wanting to find out more and more about it. 
So now I would actually like to learn more about it and get at least a bit of experience with what these people do. 

Therefore I signed up here and I really look forward to learning. 

And if there is anyone else out there who lives in London, enjoys technology and maybe also getting outside for hiking or other sports. let me know! I am always happy to meet more people.

Cheers,
Henning
